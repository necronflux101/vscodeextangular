# One Angular Pack to rule them all

One Angular Pack to rule them all is a list of extensions that I have been using for years and keep recommending to others to use as all.

Following are the list of extensions included: 

* Bracket Pair Colorizer 2 (Because Life is too short to deal with those brackets without it)
* Angular Language Service (Why not)
* CSS Peek (Class names are begging to be peeked at, from the template directly)
* Dark+ Material (Because eww light mode)
* Docker (Necessary Evil)
* Git Graph (Gotta find some to blame)
* Git History (Because I couldn't bother to look at all the files in the commits history)
* GitLens (I need to know who wrote this line. I will find you)
* HTML CSS Support (Intellisense where there is none)
* Inline HTML (More Crutches)
* Jest Runner (I can't bother to type JEST commands)
* Material Icon theme (Because you'll wont change the basic icon theme and it takes me more than 2 seconds to know what this file is)
* NX Console (NX Commands are long)
* Path Intellisense (Thanks needed this)
* Peacock (Because I always have 3 workspaces open)
* Prettier (Pls format after every 2 lines)
* SCSS Intellisense (I mean this had to be there)
* Sonarlint (Pls get rid for the squiggles)
* TS Lint (I mean, Angular duh)
* ES Lint (Because you cheat sometimes)
